Merging upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration workflows. We already know how to do this with git fetch followed by git merge, but git pull rolls this into a single command.

Usage
git pull <remote>
Fetch the specified remoteâ€™s copy of the current branch and immediately merge it into the local copy. This is the same as git fetch <remote> followed by git merge origin/<current-branch>.

git pull <remote>
